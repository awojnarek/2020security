# Security Learning Resources for 2020 (in my opinion)

## Networking

### Learning Essentials

#### CCNA (first)
> https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/

The CCNA is the industry standard start for networking. Since networking is so fundemental to security, having this certification is the *bare minimum*. This course has 80 hours of content, and is only $20.00. This equates to 25 cents per hour of content. You literally cannot be this.

#### CompTIA Security+ (second)

The CompTIA certifications are the bare minimum, easiest and most basic certifications to get. Completing this course will give you the necessary skill in order to pass the certification.

#### AWS (third)

> https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-essentials/

This course is designed to teach you the fundementals of cloud computing. It's 16 hours of content, and is $31.58 a month.  For just this course it equates to about $2.00 an hour. However this is a subscription - and not a single purchase. You get access to the entire Linux Academy instructions! In 2020 to be competitive you should have a strong focus on cloud computing, microservices, containers etc. 

In order to thrive it's simply _not_ enough to know networking and some security fundementals. The world has moved on from buying a very expensive firewall or security device and configuring it for a corporate LAN.
